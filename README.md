## Technologies
This project uses NextJS app generator as a boilerplate, including TailwindCSS. For charts, I used ChartJS library with Charts React. 

## If I had more time...
There are many, many things that I would improve. I capped the time I wanted to spend on the project at 4 hours to give myself a challenge and see how far I could go with this time limit. At the end, I started questioning if I got my priorities right, so I am happy to discuss that during our next call. To name a few of the improvements:

 1. __Understand the data better__: I worked with the data out of context. If I had a chance to speak with someone who designed the structure, I think I could understand it better and come up with better ways to display it. 
 2. __Tidy up my styling__: At the moment, it is a mix of pre-defined colours (of a palette that I found online) and the built-in classes that come with Tailwind.
 3. __Assets__: I would like to use more assets to make the website more visually attractive. For example, team logos instead of "Team 1", "Team 2" in the mobile version of the players list. 
 4. __Improve accessibility__: I believe that accessibility could be improved. The contrast between the key elements is good yet I would like to spend more time to make sure that the experience is equally engaging for different users.
